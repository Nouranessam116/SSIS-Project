# SSIS Integration – Practice Project

## Project Idea  
I built this project as part of a Business Intelligence course to practice **SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)**.  
The main goal was to explore the Integration phase and understand how to design Control Flow and Data Flow tasks.

## Tools Used  
- Visual Studio 2022  
- SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)

## Project Content  
- A set of `.dtsx` packages, each representing a different training exercise.  
- Tasks include: SQL preparation steps and Data Flow tasks for basic extract–transform–load (ETL) scenarios.  
- `Project.params` file for connection settings.

## How to Use  
This is a **training project**, not a final product.  
There is no predefined database or step-by-step run guide.  
Anyone interested can simply open the solution in **Visual Studio** (with the SSIS extension installed) to explore the package design.

## Notes  
- All tasks are purely for learning; no real data is included.  
- This represents only the **Integration** stage of a larger BI process.
